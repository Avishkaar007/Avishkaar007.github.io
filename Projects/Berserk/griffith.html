                    <p>Griffith is the current leader of the reborn Band of the Falcon and supreme commander of the
                        Midland Regular Army. Having been at the fore of many battles, he has amassed a reputation as a
                        savior across the continent, and is revered as the "Falcon of Light".

                        As the leader of the original Band of the Falcon, he and his mercenaries are able to end the
                        Hundred-Year War and bring peace to the war-torn kingdom of Midland.[10] Following the desertion
                        of his most trusted confidant Guts,[14] Griffith beds Princess Charlotte on impulse,[15]
                        bringing about his imprisonment, year-long crippling torture, and the seeming demise of his
                        dream. Though he is eventually rescued by the band,[16] his state of extreme invalidity and
                        undying desire to obtain his own kingdom compel him to sacrifice his comrades during the fifth
                        Eclipse,[11] for kinsmanship with the God Hand as their fifth member Femto a demonic,
                        idealized version of himself stripped of his human inhibitions. In time, he is incarnated into
                        the Physical World,[17] concerned solely with the realization of his dream, which comes to pass
                        with his thwarting of the Kushan invasion of Midland, the Great Roar of the Astral World he
                        prompts, and the rise of his utopian capital city, Falconia.</p>

                        <li>The <i>Berserk</i> states that circa , Griffith is 24 years old, 178 cm, and 66 kg.
                            (<b>NOTE:</b> The <i>Berserk Official Guidebook</i> is highly questionable in its veracity.)

                        <li>Griffith's God Hand name "Femto" is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femto-"
                                class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Femto-">mathematical prefix</a> for
                            1/1,000,000,000,000,000. That is one quadrillionth, or one millionth of one billionth of the
                            measurement unit this prefix is used for (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second, a
                            femtometer is one quadrillionth of a meter, etc).</li>
                        <li>In a vision Griffith has after commandeering a horse-drawn carriage, he sees his crippled
                            self living a quiet life, with Casca as his lover and care taker. Together, they have a son
                            named Guts and a dog named Pippin.</li>
                        <li>In the original Band of the Falcon's gilded years, Griffith reads up on various fields of
                            study in his downtime, including history, religion, philosophy, chemistry, tactics,
                            cosmetics, cooking, et cetera; his reason for doing so being that, "To become great, one has
                            to be able to do more than fight."</li>
                        <li>Following Griffith's incarnation, Midlanders often remark that he now possesses an
                            untouchable and inhuman presence.</li>
